# Greek Names
Classify names into Greek and non-Greek.
Also note that as mentioned (https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-Greek-names-and-surnames-end-with-the-letters-is)[here], 
*The Greek language has genders for each noun. The names that end in -s (they could and in -is, -as, -os) are all male names because the ending -s means that the gender of the word is masculine. For example, the name Pavlopoulos is a manâ€™s name while the female equivalent would be Pavlopoulou*
